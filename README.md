# Selenium-WebDriver-Automation README

## Introduction

This GitHub repository contains an automation project that utilizes various tools and technologies to streamline the testing process. The project leverages Selenium WebDriver, TestNG, Java, Streams, and other libraries to automate and enhance the testing of web applications. It also includes processes for parallel execution of test cases, cross-browser testing, and the generation of Extent Reports for comprehensive test reporting.

## Project Overview

### Tools and Technologies Used

- **Selenium WebDriver**: A powerful automation tool for web application testing.
- **TestNG**: A testing framework that facilitates test execution, configuration, and reporting.
- **Java**: The primary programming language used for writing automation scripts.
- **Streams**: Java streams are used for efficient data manipulation and processing.
- **Maven**: A build automation tool to manage project dependencies and build processes.
- **Extent Reports**: A reporting library for generating detailed test reports.
- **Parallel Execution**: The project supports parallel execution of test cases for faster testing.
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Test cases can be executed across multiple web browsers.

### Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `src/test/java`: Contains the test scripts written in Java using Selenium WebDriver and TestNG.
- `downloads`: Contains the downloaded files.
- `testng.xml`: The TestNG configuration file for test suite execution.
- `pom.xml`: The Maven project configuration file.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the automation project, make sure you have the following installed:

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 8 or higher.
2. **Maven**: Ensure Maven is installed and configured properly.
3. **WebDriver Drivers**: Download and configure WebDriver drivers for the browsers you intend to use (e.g., ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver for Firefox).

### Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/sahilSourabh/Selenium-WebDriver-Automation.git
```

### Configurations

Update the configuration files (`testng.xml`) with your specific settings, such as web URL, browser choice, and parallel execution settings.

### Running Tests

To execute the tests, run the following command from the project root directory:

```shell
mvn clean test
```

This will trigger the execution of test cases defined in the TestNG suite (`testng.xml`) and generate test reports.
